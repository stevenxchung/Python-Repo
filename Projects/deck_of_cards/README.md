# Deck of Cards (Python)

This is actually from a job interview I did years ago (I don't even remember which company ðŸ˜‚). The requirements are:

Given an array of 52 cards, write a program that provides the following functionalities:

- Shuffling the deck
- Dealing one card at a time until there are no more cards

Bonus:

- Add interactive option when dealing a card:
  - Allow user to specify how many cards they want (1-52)
  - Return "All cards dealt!" when empty
