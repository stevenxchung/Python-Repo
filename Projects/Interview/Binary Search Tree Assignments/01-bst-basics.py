'''
A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where:
  a. The value in each node to its left subtree is less than the current node
  b. The value in each node to its right subtree is greater than the current node

Looking up a value takes O(log(n)) if the tree is balanced and O(h) is the height of the tree

Implement the following:
1. Search in a BST
2. Insert into a BST
3. Delete Node in a BST
